## Achlys usage examples

### Estimation of Pi
The following [Code](https://github.com/achlysproject/achlys/blob/master/resources/examples/PI.md) shows how
Achlys can be used to perform approximations of the value of Ï€. The approximation becomes more accurate as the number
participating nodes increases. The entire computation can be declared in a single Achlys Task using the `achlys:declare/4`
function. Then, it can be propagated in a cluster using `achlys:bite/1` with the variable containing
the task given as a parameter.

### Adding a `gen_server` to provide tasks automatically
Achlys can be easily extended with a new application-specific server that acts as a [Task Provider](https://github.com/achlysproject/achlys/blob/master/resources/TASK_MODEL.md)
that can automatically interact with the Achlys Task model as demonstrated in the `achlys_task_provider.erl` example
module.
